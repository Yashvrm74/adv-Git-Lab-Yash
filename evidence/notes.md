# Notes - PR Strategy & Merge

- Feature branch: feature/auth
- Conflict: README.md edited on both branches (main: Project: A, feature/auth: Project: B)
- Resolution: Resolved locally using vi; final content combined into "Project: A & B".
- Merge strategy: Merge commit chosen to preserve full branch history.
- Rationale: Keeps visibility of conflict resolution for review and learning.
